## Overview
This project will perform accurate facial recognition on a large dataset of human faces and facial expressions in order to accurately determine the emotion of a given face.
- Our predictive model will determine if a face has 1 of the seven universal facial expressions: **Happy, Neutral, Sad, Angry, Fear, Surprise, and Disgust**

## Why Emotion Recognition?
Emotion recogintion is highly beneficial in the following areas: 
- **Security**: Spotting abnormal facial patterns when a suspect is being interrogated/questioned, or for use in criminal identification in surveillance footage.
- **Healthcare**: Provide real time patient feedback of pain or discomfort.
- **Video Games**: Better understanding of facial points for game developers to create more accurate character depictions in their renderings.
- **Automotive Industry**: Detect when drivers are unfit to drive (if falling asleep, extremely upset or angry, etc.)
- **Human-Robot Interaction**: Interacting with a robotic social agent (ex. a automated response bot), it is helpful to receive emotional feedback on how the customer is feeling when interacting with this agent to better improve the agents performance.
